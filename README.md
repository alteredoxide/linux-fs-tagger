# linux-fs-tagger (tag)

linux-fs-tagger is currently a very minimal (alpha) command-line tool for
creating and managing tags for directories and files within any file system that
supports extended attriubtes (xattrs).
All major linux file systems offer support:
- Ext4
- Btrfs
- ZFS
- XFS
This alpha offers very basic support for set, list, find, and remove.

I made this just to toy with having a simple tool for tagging files and
directories on my own systems, so there is a good chance this will not receive
a lot of support.

**Installation & examples coming soon**
